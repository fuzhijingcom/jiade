Changelog
-----------

Version 0.1
	-- Initial Version Released
	
Version 0.2
	-- Styling Done

Version 0.3
	-- Error resolved.

Version 0.3.1
	Below are following resolved points:-
	-- On the all_the_cool_cats issue, the problem wasn't with the name of the variables, but with the name of the transient itself(sorry if I wasn't clear enough on it). Variables inside of your functions you can name however you like, but since the transient will be stored in the database, just like post meta, it needs to have a custom prefix. So the name of your transient(what you pass to get_transient() and set_transient()) should be tc_e_commerce_shop_all_the_cool_cats.

    --It seems like you accidentally removed the template-parts folder, so now I can't check the sticky post fix :)

    --The fix for the IE style is to simply remove the dependency(as that's what preventing the style from being enqueued). Here's the updated code: wp_enqueue_style('tc-e-commerce-shop-ie', get_template_directory_uri().'/css/ie.css');

    --On the screenshot and image licensing, you need to declare all images that are part of the screenshot. So not just the background image, but also the camera image, the woman, shoes, watch and sunglasses.

    --Also on the screenshot - I don't feel like it follows the requirement of being a reasonable representation of what the theme can look like. I'm going to highlight the specific issues that I'm seeing in terms of the screenshot vs the theme installed locally:

    --There's no way in the theme to hide the site title
    --There's no way to change any of the content over the slider background. The title and "Learn More" are automatically inserted over the featured image and centered.
    --The arrows are still not exactly like in the screenshot.
    --The styling of the products is not the same as in the screenshot
    --The red border(left, right and bottom), as well as the black bar on the bottom do not exist in the actual theme

Version 0.3.2
	Below are following resolved points:-
	-- In template-tags.php, you're still calling delete_transient( 'all_the_cool_cats' ); instead of delete_transient( 'tc_e_commerce_shop_all_the_cool_cats' );

	-- The instructions on how to setup the home page should be part of the readme, or otherwise implemented for the end-user to see(you can add descriptions to the Customizer sections for example). Adding the instructions to the readme will be enough in general.
